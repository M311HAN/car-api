Reasons for Changes
Type Module:

Added "type": "module" to enable ES module support, allowing the use of import and 
export syntax instead of require and module.exports.
Testing Dependencies:

Added chai, chai-http, and mocha as devDependencies to support writing and running tests for the 
application.
Scripts:

Updated the "test" script to run mocha tests, facilitating automated testing.
Consistent Dependency Management:

Ensured that all necessary dependencies and devDependencies are listed to maintain a consistent development 
and testing environment.
Updated Project Structure (Visual Reference)
The structure reflects the inclusion of new dependencies and the updated config.js for managing configurations.

Conclusion
The updates to package.json enhance the maintainability, testing, and security of the application. By enabling 
ES module support and adding essential testing tools, 
the project is now better equipped for robust development and deployment practices.

Implemented comprehensive tests using Mocha and Chai, including tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
Tests ensure that the application correctly handles all CRUD operations.

• Benefits of a Separate Config File
Separation of Concerns:

Separates configuration settings from application logic, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
Environment-Specific Configurations:

Easily manage different configurations for different environments (development, testing, production) without 
changing the application logic.
Centralized Configuration Management:

Centralizes all configuration settings in one place, making it easier to update and manage configurations.
Security:

Sensitive information (like API keys, database URLs) can be managed in environment variables and accessed in 
the config file, keeping them out of the main application code.
Scalability:

As the application grows, new configurations can be added easily without cluttering the main application files.

• The switch from const and require to import and export aligns the project with modern JavaScript standards, 
enhancing compatibility, readability, and future-proofing the codebase. 
This update ensures better integration with modern tools and environments, leveraging the benefits of ES Modules.

• Refactoring Report for frontend:

Overview
The App.js file of the application was originally handling multiple responsibilities, including state management, 
form handling, and rendering the UI. To improve the maintainability, readability, and modularity of the code, we 
refactored the App.js file by splitting it into separate components. This approach follows the best practices of 
component-based architecture in React.

Changes Made

1. Component Creation:

CarList Component:
Moved the logic for displaying the list of cars, and handling the deletion and initiation of updates to this component.
Improved separation of concerns by keeping the list-related logic encapsulated within the CarList component.

CarForm Component:
Extracted the form for adding a new car into its own component.
This change simplifies the main App component and makes the form reusable if needed in the future.

UpdateCarForm Component:
Created a separate component for updating an existing car.
This component is used within the CarList component to handle updates, making the update logic modular and easier to manage.

2.App Component Refactoring:

State Management:
The state variables related to cars and form inputs remain in the App component, which acts as the central state manager.

Function Handling:
Functions for adding, updating, and deleting cars remain in the App component but are passed down as props to the 
respective components.
Validation logic is kept within the App component to maintain a single source of truth for form validation.

Rationale

1. Improved Readability and Maintainability:

By breaking down the App.js file into smaller components, each component now has a single responsibility, making the code 
easier to read and maintain.
Future developers can easily understand and modify individual components without affecting the overall application.

2. Enhanced Reusability:

The CarForm and UpdateCarForm components can be reused or modified independently, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.

3. Separation of Concerns:

Separating the UI logic (displaying cars, forms) from the main application logic (state management, API calls) adheres to the 
principle of separation of concerns. This makes the application more modular and easier to test.

4. Scalability:

The refactored structure makes it easier to scale the application. Adding new features or modifying existing ones can be done with 
minimal impact on other parts of the application.
Conclusion
The refactoring of App.js into smaller, well-defined components improves the overall code quality of the application. 
This change aligns with React best practices and prepares the application for future scalability and maintenance. 
The new structure not only enhances readability and maintainability but also promotes a clean and modular codebase.

Changes Made
Frontend Form Validation:

Validation Logic:
Implemented form validation on the React frontend to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly.
Added checks to ensure the number of seats is a positive integer and does not exceed a specified maximum value.
Added validation for the image URL format to ensure that only valid URLs are accepted.
Rationale:
These validations prevent users from submitting incomplete or incorrect data, which can lead to errors and a poor user experience.
By validating inputs on the frontend, we reduce the chances of invalid data reaching the backend, thereby improving data integrity.
Error Handling for API Requests:

Error Messaging:
Added error handling for API requests in the frontend to display user-friendly error messages if a request fails.
Implemented loading states while requests are in progress to provide visual feedback to the user.
Rationale:
Providing clear and informative error messages helps users understand what went wrong and how to correct it.
Loading states improve the user experience by indicating that a request is in progress, preventing confusion and potential 
repeated submissions.
Backend Input Sanitization:

Sanitization Implementation:
Integrated input sanitization in the backend using libraries such as express-validator or sanitize-html.
Sanitized and validated user input before processing or storing it to prevent potential security issues like Cross-Site 
Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Rationale:
Input sanitization is a crucial security practice that helps prevent malicious user input from compromising the application.
By cleaning and validating input, we protect the backend from security vulnerabilities and ensure that only safe and expected 
data is processed.

To ensure the robustness and reliability of our front-end application, i implemented comprehensive testing using Jest and React 
Testing Library. The tests are organized to cover both individual components and the main application functionality. 
Below is an overview of the testing approach and the key aspects covered:

Testing Strategy
Component-Level Tests:

CarForm: Ensures the form renders correctly and handles input changes as expected.
UpdateCarForm: Verifies that the update form renders correctly and processes input changes properly.
CarList: Tests the rendering of the car list, deletion, and initiation of updates.
Integration Test:

AppIntegration: Tests the main App component to ensure it integrates all parts correctly and handles adding, updating, and deleting cars.
Key Tests Implemented
Rendering Tests:

Verify that key elements, such as the "Car List" title, are rendered correctly.
Form Handling:

Ensure that input fields in the CarForm and UpdateCarForm components handle user input as expected.
API Interaction:

Mock API requests to verify that the application correctly handles fetching, adding, updating, and deleting cars without actual backend interaction.
State Management:

Check that the application state updates correctly in response to user actions, such as adding a new car or updating an existing one.
Test Organization
Tests are located in the __tests__ directory within the components folder, ensuring they are close to the components they test for better maintainability and organization.
An additional integration test file, AppIntegration.test.js, is located in the src directory to cover the main application functionality.
Benefits
Improved Reliability: Automated tests help ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
Maintainability: Well-organized tests make it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.
Efficiency: Tests catch issues early, reducing the time and effort required for manual testing.
By implementing these tests, i have created a safety net that helps maintain the quality and stability of our front-end application as it evolves.
